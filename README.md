<!-- Brief -->
<p align="center">
This app filters jobs by role, level, languages, and tools. It receives data from a local JSON file and manipulates it conditionally to provide the most relevant results. This project was a great way to practice filtering methods, and later upgrading it to TypeScript (starting from version 2.0.0) further enhanced type safety and maintainability.
